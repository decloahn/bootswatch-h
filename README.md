Bootstrap theme for Hoiio
==========


Usage
-----
Download the compiled bootstrap.zip from Twitter's Bootstrap page

In "swatchmaker/swatch" directory, you'll find four css files:

 + bootstrap.css
 + bootstrap.min.css
 + bootstrap-responsive.css
 + bootstrap-responsive.min.css

Copy these files, and replace the original css from stock Bootstrap.
